Current design trends require complex designs which allow horizontal scrolling inside vertical scrolling. So to show the users that they can scroll vertically, a peeking item should be shown on the side. This library does exactly that.
I wrote this library because there's no pod that does this simple feature. Also, other libraries require me to inherit from a UICollectionViewController, which doesn't give alot of freedom if I'm inheriting from other View Controllers.
